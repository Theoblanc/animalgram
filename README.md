## Description

Animalgram is an app built using the framework of nest.js and next.js. The server is designed based on the DDD architecture and CQRS.

## Architecture

This repository presents examples of applications using domain-driven design and CQRS using nest, a nodejs framework using typescript.

The domain-driven design consists of four layers, each consisting of interface, application, domain, and infrastructure.

### Domain Layer

The domain layer is the core layer in domain-driven design and the highest level layer that does not depend on any layer.
